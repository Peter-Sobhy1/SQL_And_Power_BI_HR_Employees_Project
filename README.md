# Instruction
ðŸ“Š Dive into the HR analytics world! This project explores employee data to uncover insights into workforce demographics, turnover rates, and departmental trends. By analyzing key metrics, we aim to provide actionable insights for HR decision-making.

# Background
 Driven by the need to understand workforce dynamics, this project was born from a desire to analyze employee data, including gender breakdowns, age distributions, turnover rates, and departmental trends. The goal is to provide HR teams with data-driven insights to improve employee retention and optimize workforce planning.

## The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:
1. What is the gender breakdown of employees in the company?

2. What is the race/ethnicity breakdown of employees?

3. What is the age distribution of employees?

4. How many employees work at headquarters versus remote locations?

5. What is the average length of employment for terminated employees?

6. How does the gender distribution vary across departments?

7. What is the distribution of job titles across the company?

8. Which department has the highest turnover rate?

9. What is the distribution of employees across locations by city and state?

10. How has the company's employee count changed over time based on hire and term dates?

11. What is the tenure distribution for each department?

12. What is the total number of employees and departments?

# Tools I Used

For this HR analytics project, I leveraged the following tools:

**SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and extract critical insights.

**SQL Server:** The chosen database management system for storing and managing employee data.

**Visual Studio Code:** My go-to tool for writing and executing SQL queries.

**Power BI:** Used to create visualizations and reports by connecting directly to the SQL Server database using import mode.

**Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis.
